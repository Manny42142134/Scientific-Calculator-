<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br>Welcome to the Scientific Calculator Application  This intuitive and powerful tool is designed  for normal arithmetic operations, trig functions, and number system  conversions for everyday use for a student.</br>
<h2>Key Features:</h2><br>
Numerical Inputs & Basic Operations: Easily input any number from 0 to 9 and perform standard mathematical operations.

Trigonometric Functions: Compute sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions, essential for students and professionals dealing with trigonometry.

Logarithmic Calculations: Effortlessly perform logarithmic calculations, a must-have feature for scientific and engineering tasks.

Number System Conversions: Unique to this calculator is its ability to convert numbers between different systems. Effortlessly switch between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.

Clear and Equal Functions: The calculator includes a clear function for resetting calculations and an equal function to display results, enhancing user experience and accuracy.

Decimal Point Support: Includes functionality for handling decimal points, allowing for precise and complex calculations.

This application is very useful application because we use a calculator for everyday use in life especially students from middle school to college students.</br>

<p>the button numbers labeled through 0-9 interact with these functions for the trig functions highlighted in red the numbers can do sin(0-9) and so on for the other trig operations.
For the operations highlighted in blue, they convert the numbers to decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal whatever the application user wants to input the numbers to.

The operations highlighted in green are the buttons that every calculator has,  you can use the numbers to divide multiply, add, and subtract. The operations highlighted in purple are the buttons to set the operations to equal or clear the display of the calculator.</p>
